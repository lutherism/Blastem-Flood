    Converted to C# 27-02-13 - no credit wanted.
    Simple flycam I made, since I couldn't find any others made public.
    Made simple to use (drag and drop, done) for regular keyboard layout
    wasd : basic movement
    shift : Makes camera accelerate
    space : Moves camera on X and Z axis only.  So camera doesn't gain any height*/


    float mainSpeed = 100.0f; //regular speed
    float shiftAdd = 250.0f; //multiplied by how long shift is held.  Basically running
    float maxShift = 1000.0f; //Maximum speed when holdin gshift
    float camSens = 0.25f; //How sensitive it with mouse
    private Vector3 lastMouse = new Vector3(255, 255, 255); //kind of in the middle of the screen, rather than at the top (play)
    private float totalRun= 1.0f;

    void Start() {
      Screen.lockCursor = true;
    }

    void Update () {

        //Input.mousePosition = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
        //lastMouse =  Input.mousePosition;
        //Mouse  camera angle done.
    }
